Treatment involves identifying and avoiding triggers, using emollients to moisturize the skin, and applying topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids should be used as directed by a healthcare professional, typically for a short duration and in a thin layer over affected areas. If symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, or if there are signs of infection, it's advisable to consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and management."

People often refer to them as spider veins. They can occur anywhere on the body or face. For most people, telangiectasias neither cause any damage to overall health nor require treatment. However, they can sometimes indicate a more severe medical condition and may warrant closer inspection. There is no cure for telangiectasia, but it is treatable. Laser therapy is minimally invasive and is typically the most straightforward treatment for telangiectasia and broken capillaries. Laser ablation can seal the widened blood vessels. This procedure does not cause much pain, and the recovery time is short. Sclerotherapy is also an effective option where a solution is injected into the veins causing inflammation and hence shrinkage of the veins."

Discoid eczema can also occur in association with atopic eczema. Scrapings are commonly taken for mycology, as discoid eczema can look very similar to tinea corporis (ringworm infection). As discoid eczema is associated with loss of skin barrier function, it is important to protect the skin from injury. Apply emollients frequently and avoid irritants. Use topical steroid cream twice daily for 2-4 weeks and oral antihistamines if needed. If resistant to treatment, consult your dermatologist to exclude ringworm or take a skin biopsy to exclude superficial basal cell carcinoma."

After touching the area with ringworm, wash your hands before touching another area of your body. Ringworm thrives in warm, moist areas, so you want to keep the area clean and dry. Avoid wearing clothes, socks, and shoes that make you sweat. Shower after working out and avoid sharing towels and other personal items. To avoid re-infecting yourself with infected items, you should wash clothes, towels, and bedding that you use while you have ringworm. Be sure to wash everything in hot, soapy water. If you suspect your pet has ringworm, take the animal to your vet as some types of ringworms grow on pets. Apply topical antifungal cream (preferably azoles group like miconazole or clotrimazole) twice daily for 2-4 weeks and sometimes systemic antifungal is used in resistant cases."

Symptoms may include itching, burning, stinging, and cracking of the skin. In some cases, blisters or ulcers may also develop. To treat athlete's foot, over-the-counter antifungal creams or sprays containing ingredients such as clotrimazole, miconazole, or terbinafine can be applied to the affected area twice daily for at least 2 to 4 weeks, or as directed by a healthcare professional. It's important to keep the affected area clean and dry, wear clean socks made of breathable materials, and avoid walking barefoot in public places such as gym showers or locker rooms to prevent spreading the infection.

If the paronychia is severe or doesn't improve with home care, it's important to see a doctor, who may prescribe antibiotics such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin if there's evidence of bacterial infection. These antibiotics are typically taken for 7 to 14 days, as directed by your healthcare provider. If there's an abscess present, your doctor may need to drain it. Always follow your doctor's advice and finish the prescribed course of antibiotics even if symptoms improve, to ensure the infection is fully treated.
